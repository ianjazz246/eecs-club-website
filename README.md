## About images
`src/images/` are for images that are processed by image-sharp. They are resized and optimized by image-sharp.
`static/img/uploads/` are for images that are uploaded by Netlify CMS.
`static/` has images for favicons and stuff
`static/img/` is for everything else.
Maybe all images could be in /src/images and the images needed unmodified could be copied to public?
